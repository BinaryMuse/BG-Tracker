This is just a small Rails app I wrote to help keep track of which realms I see in PvP to have conclusive proof (and end long discussions) about cross-battlegroup PvP.

Rake task to kick things off (`rake app:import`) can be found at [`lib/tasks/import.rake`](https://github.com/BinaryMuse/BG-Tracker/blob/master/lib/tasks/import.rake).
